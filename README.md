Another sad day in the world of homebrew, folks. On our forums, Homer (AKA Moonchild)  has announced his departure from the homebrew scene. He is not, however, leaving without making a mark on the community.<br><br>Homer is best known for trying to develop a homebrew version of the Harvest Moon games, called A Farmer's Life. Now that he's leaving, however, he's opted to put his source code in the hands of other developers to use. His Farmer's Life source code should serve as more than just a Harvest Moon base, as he says it can also be used as the basis for any number of 2D RPG homebrews that developers might want to try making.<br><br>Whether that means you'll fulfill his legacy by creating a full-fledged farming homebrew or a remake of FFVII in sprites for the PSP is up to you. It's licensed, so you might want to remember him in your games if you plan on using his source. We'll miss him, that's for sure, and we'll be waiting here with open arms if ever he wishes to return to the homebrew scene.<br><br>To Homer: You Rock!
